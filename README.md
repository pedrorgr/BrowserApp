# Browser App

Browser iOS App:

- Arquitecture: MVVM
- Favorites stored in UserDefaults to be faster and pratical otherwise I would use Core Data
- Unit tests missing


Browser Lib:

- The lib is included in one workspace that includes also the iOS app
- Using URL sessions for Http request
- Also missing Unit tests
